### Requirements

1. Create a generic hotel list page using the following api: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f23442e00005000b56873
2. Show only the cheapest price for each hotel on the list page using this api: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f24f02e00005200b56875 (null prices mean sold out)
3. On clicking a hotel, display a hotel detail page with details from this api: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f265b2e00005d00b56877 along with the respective room prices using the above price api.

### Points of Interest

1. Repo setup and folder structure
2. Identification of components that should carry state vs components that are only concerned with display (smart vs dumb components)
3. Proper use of methods to fetch data, push into state, etc
4. State management is left completely upto you (however, would prefer to see redux)
5. Styling best practises and principles. (You may copy the design from the Treebo Website or use any of your own. Only create the listing and detail pages).
